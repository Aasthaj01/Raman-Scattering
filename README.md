# Raman-Scattering
Raman spectroscopy relies upon inelastic scattering of photons, known as Raman scattering. The laser light interacts with molecular vibrations, phonons or other excitations in the system, resulting in the energy of the laser photons being shifted up or down.
Simulation is done using OptiSystem 2019 software
